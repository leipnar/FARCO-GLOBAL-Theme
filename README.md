## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is set up to run directly in the browser using ES modules and a CDN for dependencies, so there's no complex build step required.

### Prerequisites

You just need a modern web browser and a simple local web server.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Serve the project files:**
    You can use any simple static file server. Here are a couple of popular options:

    *   **Using Python:**
        ```sh
        # If you have Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```

    *   **Using Node.js (with the `serve` package):**
        ```sh
        # If you don't have 'serve' installed globally, you can use npx
        npx serve
        ```

3.  **Open in browser:**
    Navigate to the local address provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost:3000`). The application should load.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

The project is organized with a clear and logical structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML entry point, includes CDN links and base styles
â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx           # React application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx             # Root component with React Router configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ constants.tsx       # Mock data, SVG icons, and other constants
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts            # TypeScript type definitions for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json       # Application metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ components/         # Reusable React components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Header.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Footer.tsx
â””â”€â”€ pages/              # Page-level components
    â”œâ”€â”€ HomePage.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ AboutPage.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ ContactPage.tsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...and more
```

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- **React 19:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development (used via CDN).
- **React Router:** For client-side routing and navigation.
- **ES Modules:** The entire application uses native browser ES modules, loaded via `esm.sh` CDN, eliminating the need for a local bundler for development.
